<!-- More on middle  -->
- Express middeware is complatibnle with connect middle

Connect is a web app framework for NODE.js that only provides the middleware layer

- you if cannot find a express middleware package with the functionality you'd like, you can search for a connect middleware moedule instead.



<!--There are different types of middleware; for our purposes, weâ€™ll group them into:   -->


 - Built-in middleware.      e.g = express.json

 - Third-party middleware.    

 - Custom middleware.

 - Built-in middleware is included with Express, but not added to the application automatically. Like the other types, we need to opt-in to using it in our application.

 - We saw an example of built-in middleware when we added support for parsing JSON content out of the request body using server.use(express.json());.
